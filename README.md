# janus
A blog and podcast theme for Ghost.

## This is a work in progress.
Please excuse the blankness of this README file while development on the theme is ongoing.

For now, here are some key details:
- I'm calling the theme "Janus" after the [Roman deity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus) who looks both forward and backward. It's meant to be a versatile theme that can adapt to both written and audio-visual content (e.g., a blog and a podcast).
- The theme is inspired by [Alto](https://github.com/TryGhost/Alto) and [Headline](https://github.com/TryGhost/Headline) and begins as a [fork of the former](https://github.com/norman-codes/alto-with-dark-mode-toggle), with design elements inspired by the latter (which I experimented with in another repository [here](https://github.com/norman-codes/bloglettercast)).
